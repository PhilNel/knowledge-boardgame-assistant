The fourth (Blue) deck of Item cards contains Crafted Items. These Items **cannot be found by searching** the Rooms. They can be assembled with a **Craft Item Basic Action**, using other Items in your possession.

You may look through the Crafting deck at any moment of the game. Cards from it are never drawn during the game, instead, when Crafting an Item, look for corresponding Crafted Item card and take it.

## Crafting Components

Crafted Item cards display **2 grey Component icons** representing the Components required to build this Item.

The following Items can be used as Components for the Crafted Item Action:

- **Chemical**: Alcohol, Chemicals
- **Cloth**: Bandages, Clothes
- **Electrical**: Energy Charges
- **Medical**: Medkit
- **Tool**: Duct Tape, Tools

## Craft Item Basic Action

To build a Crafted Item, you must perform a Craft Item Basic Action and discard two Item cards showing the blue Component icons corresponding to the grey Components icons of the Crafted Item you want to build (the first Item card corresponding to the first required Component icon, and the second Item card corresponding to the second required Component icon).

## Limitations

- A Crafted Item **cannot** be built if its card is not available, even if you have the required blue components.
