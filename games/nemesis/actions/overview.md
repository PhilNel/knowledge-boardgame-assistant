Actions are the primary way characters interact with the game world. Players have a total of 2 Actions per round during the **Player Phase**.

## Types of Actions

There are four main groups of Actions:

- **Basic Actions**: Each Character has the same set of Basic Actions. These Actions are always available for each Character, as long as they meet their conditions [[R1-BASIC]].
  - **Examples**: Movement, Careful Movement, Shoot
- **Actions from Action Cards**: Each Character has its own, partially unique set of 10 Action cards representing the Actions which can be performed by this Character [[R1-CARD-ACTION]].
  - **Examples**: Search, Rest, Demolition
- **Actions from Item Cards**: Some Item cards allow a Character to perform specific Actions [[R1-ITEM-ACTION]].
  - **Examples**: Bandages, Cloth, Energy Charge
- **Actions from Room Tiles (Room Actions)**: Most of the Rooms allow a Character to perform a specific Action [[R1-ROOM-ACTION]].
  - **Examples**: Send a Signal, Analyse 1 Object, Take One Egg

## Action Economy and Cost

Every Action has an associated Action Cost, indicated by a number in its Action icon [[R1-ACTION-COST]]. To perform an Action, a player must discard the exact number of any chosen Action cards from their hand to their discard pile. Discarded cards are placed face up in the discard pile.

**Examples**:

- **"Search"**: This Action card has a printed cost of 0. This means only that Action card needs to be discarded in order to perform the Search Action.
- **Captain's "Basic Repairs"**: This Action card has a printed cost of 2. This means that both the "Basic Repairs" card and **two additional** Action cards must be discarded in order to perform this Action [[CAP1]].

- **Contamination Cards**: It's crucial to note that Contamination cards, although part of your Action deck and hand, are not Action cards and **cannot be discarded to pay** any Action Cost. They represent character exhaustion or worse [[R1-CONTAMINATION]].

## Combat and Action Restrictions

Some Actions and Items have specific restrictions on when they can be used [[R1-ACTION-COMBAT]]:

- **In Combat Only**:
  - Represented by a **Pistol weapon icon only** in the upper right corner of the Action card.
  - The Character may perform this Action only in Combat. A Character is considered to be in Combat if there is an Intruder in their Room.
  - **Example**: The "Suppressive Fire" Action card.
  - **Note**: Eggs do not count as Intruders [[R1-ACTION-COMBAT]].
- **Out of Combat Only**:
  - Represented by a Pistol weapon icon **with a "cross" through it** in the upper right corner of the Action card.
  - The Character may perform this Action only when they are **not** in Combat.
  - **Example**: The "Search" Action card.
- **No Symbol Present**:
  - If an Action has no special symbol, it can be performed both in and out of Combat.
  - **Example**: The "Demolition" Action card.

## Player Rounds and Passing

During the Player Phase, starting with the First Player, each Character performs a round of 2 Actions [[R1-PLAYER-PHASE]]. Players can choose to perform 2 Actions, 1 Action and then pass, or simply pass their turn. Once a player has passed, they cannot perform any further Actions during that Player Phase [[R1-PLAYER-PHASE]].
