Each Character has the same set of Basic Actions. These Actions are always available for each Character, as long as they meet their conditions.

## Performing a Basic Action

A detailed description of Basic Actions is given below.

- **Movement**: Move your Character miniature to a neighboring Room, applying all the Movement basic rules. Costs 1 Action card [[R1-BASIC-ACTION]].
- **Careful Movement**: Works exactly like Movement, but instead of performing a Noise roll after moving, place a Noise marker in a chosen Corridor connected to the Room you are entering. Costs 2 Action cards [[R1-BASIC-ACTION]].
  - **Note**: If there is a Noise marker in all the Corridors connected to the Room you want to move to, you **cannot** perform a Careful Movement [[R1-BASIC-ACTION]]. Any given Corridor may never hold more than 1 Noise marker.
  - **Important**: You **cannot** perform Careful Movement if you are in Combat [[R1-BASIC-ACTION]].
- **Shoot**: Attack an Intruder with a Weapon placed in your Character's Hand, discarding an Ammo marker from that Weapon's card. Costs 1 Action card [[R1-SHOOT]].
  - **Note**: You can only Shoot Intruders in the **same Room** as your Character [[R1-BASIC-ACTION]].
- **Melee Attack**: Attack an Intruder with your bare hands (doesn't require Ammo or a Weapon). Costs 1 Action card [[R1-MELEE]].
  - **Important**: This Action requires drawing 1 Contamination card and adding it to your discard pile as part of its cost. Missing a Melee Attack also results in suffering 1 Serious Wound [[R1-MELEE]].
  - **Note**: You can only Melee Attack Intruders in the **same Room** as your Character [[R1-MELEE]].

- **Trade**: Start a trade with all Characters in the same Room as your Character. Players may now show each other any Item cards and Objects they want to trade. Costs 1 Action card [[R1-BASIC-ACTION]].
  - A player can choose to give an Item card or Object without asking anything in Return.
  - **Note**: Only if both involved players agree on the transaction, they exchange the items [[R1-BASIC-ACTION]].
  - **Important**: Even though several players may take part in the Trade, the only player that performs the Action is the one that started it [[R1-BASIC-ACTION]].
  - **Note**: Characters cannot exchange Ammo.
- **Craft Item**: Discard 2 Item cards showing the appropriate blue Craft icons to gain a Crafted Item card with the same Craft icons (but in gray color) as the Items you have discarded. Costs 1 Action card. [[R1-BASIC-ACTION]].
  - **Note**: A Crafted Item cannot be built if its card is not available, even if you have the required blue components [[R1-BASIC-ACTION]].

  - **Note**: It cannot be used when in Combat.
