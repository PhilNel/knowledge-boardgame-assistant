If a Character does not scan their Contamination cards before the game ends, these cards can lead to their death during the Victory Check.

## Scanning Procedure

- Take the Scanner and place its red foil part over the coded field of the Contamination card you're Scanning
- In one of the lines of text, the word "INFECTED" may appear. If not, the card is **not infected**.
- **Note**: It's important to look closely, as some coded words might appear similar to "INFECTED".
- In both of these cases, any **additional Scanning effect** is explained in the description of the given Action card, Room Action or Item Action.

## Consequences of Scanning

- **Infected**: If you're INFECTED, place a Larva miniature on your Character board if one is not already there. This "INFECTED" Contamination card is **not** removed.
- **Immediate Death**: If there is already a Larva on your Character board, your Character dies â€“ additionally, place 1 Creeper in the Room where you died.
- **Removal**: If any rule asks you to remove a Contamination card, remove this card from the game.

## Initiating Scanning

Characters can scan their Contamination cards through various actions or items:

- **Rest Action Card**: Allows scanning of all Contamination cards in your hand and removal of non-Infected cards.
- **Canteen Room Action**: Characters may also choose to Scan all Contamination cards in their hand and remove all non-Infected cards.
- **Shower Room Action**: Allows you to optionally scan all Contamination cards in your hand and remove all non-Infected cards.
- **Surgery Room Action**: Allows Characters to perform a Surgery procedure by scanning all Contamination cards (from their deck, hand, and discard pile) and removing all Infected cards. If a Larva is on the character board, it is removed. After Surgery, the character suffers 1 Light Wound and automatically passes their round.
- **Antidote Crafted Item Action**: Scan all cards in your Action deck, hand, and discard pile. Remove all INFECTED cards (and a Larva if you have one). Then, take 1 Contamination card and shuffle it with your Action deck and discard pile.

The following Event can also cause Characters to scan their Contamination cards:

- **Eclosion Event Card**: Each Character with a Larva on their Character board dies (place a Creep in their Room). Every Character draws 4 cards from their deck and Scans all drawn Contamination cards. If they have **at least** 1 INFECTED card, put a Larva on their Character board. Discard drawn cards.
