Contamination in Nemesis is a critical mechanic that represents your character's potential infection by the Intruders, adding a layer of hidden threat and strategic risk.

## Overview

- **Hand Management**: Although Contamination cards share a common back with Action cards and are held in your hand, they **cannot be discarded to pay any Action Cost**.
- **Hidden Information**: Each Contamination card contains hidden information: whether your Character is "INFECTED" or not. This information is concealed by colorful patterns within the card's text field and remains unknown until the card is "Scanned".
  **Note**: Some Event cards may force the player to Scan their Contamination cards.

## Obtaining

- **Intruder Attacks**: Some Intruder Attack cards, when resolved, may cause the targeted Character to receive a Contamination card. For example, the "Scratch" Adult Attack causes the Character to take 1 Light Wound and receive 1 Contamination Card.
- **Larva Infest**: If a Larva performs an Intruder Attack, no Intruder Attack card is drawn. Instead, the Larva miniature is removed from the board and placed on the target Character's board, and the targeted player receives 1 Contamination card.
- **Melee Attacks**: When a Character performs a Melee Attack Action, they must draw 1 Contamination card and add it to their Action discard pile as part of the cost.
