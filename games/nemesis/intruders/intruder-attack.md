Intruder attacks in Nemesis occur in three primary scenarios:

- **Surprise Attack**: This happens during an Encounter if the Character who triggered it has fewer cards in their hand (Action and Contamination cards) than the number on the drawn Intruder token.
- **Intruder Attack Step in the Event Phase**: During the Event Phase, any Intruder currently in Combat with a Character will attack.
- **Character's Escape**: When a Character attempts to escape from Combat by performing a Movement Action to a neighboring room, an Intruder Attack is resolved before they move. If multiple Intruders are in the room, a separate attack is resolved for each.

## Attack Resolution

Intruder Attacks are resolved as follows:

- **Choose the Target Character**:

  - The Intruder will attack a Character in the **same room**.
  - **Multiple Targets**: If there's more than one Character, the Intruder targets the Character whose player has the fewest Action cards in their hand. In case of a tie, the Character with the First Player token (or the next player in turn order) is attacked.
  - **Surprise Attack**: For a Surprise Attack, the target is the Character who triggered the Encounter.
  - **Escape**: For an Escape attempt, the target is the Character performing the Escape Action.

- **Draw and Resolve 1 Intruder Attack Card**:

  - An Intruder Attack card is drawn.
  - **Matching Intruder Symbol**: If the card displays an Intruder Symbol (Larva, Creeper, Adult, Breeder, Queen) corresponding to the attacking Intruder, the effect described on the Intruder Attack card is resolved.
  - **No Matching Symbol**: If there is no corresponding symbol on the card, the attack **misses**.
  - **Important**: During an Intruder Attack, the "blood" icon in the upper left corner of the Intruder Attack card is ignored.

- **Discarding Cards**:
  - After resolving the Intruder Attack card, it is placed in the Intruder discard pile.
  - If the Intruder Attack deck runs out of cards, its discard pile is shuffled to form a new deck.

## Larva Infest

If the Intruder Attack is performed by a **Larva**, **do not draw** any Intruder Attack cards. Apply the following instead:

- Remove the Larva miniature from the board and place it on the Character board of the target of this attack, on the miniature picture.
- The targeted player gets 1 Contamination Card.
- **Note**: This includes Intruder Attacks that occur due to an Escape attempt by a Character.
