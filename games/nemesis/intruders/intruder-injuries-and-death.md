# Intruder Injuries and Death

Category: Intruders - Injuries and Death
Related Systems: Combat, fire

In Nemesis, Intruder Injuries and Death are determined through a specific process involving Injury markers, Intruder Attack cards, and the Combat die.

## Injury Effect Check

When any Intruder suffers Injuries (for example as a result of a successful Character attack or from Fire), place the corresponding number of Injury markers on its base.
**Note**: "Five Injuries" tokens are available to help track injuries on larger Intruders like the Queen or Breeders

As soon as the Injury markers have been placed, perform the **Injury Effect Check**:

- **Larva and Egg**:
  - 1 Injury is enough to kill them. Remove their miniature / token from the board.
- **Creeper or Adult Intruder**:
  – Draw 1 Intruder Attack card.
  - Ignore everything on this card except the “blood” icon in the upper left corner of the card. 
  - If the number in the “blood” icon of the card is **equal to or lower** than the current number of Injury markers on this Intruder, it is **killed**.
  - If the number in the "blood" icon is **higher**, the Intruder is still **alive**.
- **Breeder or Queen**:
  - Draw 2 Intruder Attack cards.
  - Ignore everything on these cards except the "blood" icon in the upper left corner of each card.
  - Add the values of their "blood" icons.
  - If the total value of the "blood" icons of the two cards is **equal to or lower** than the current number of Injury markers on this Intruder, it is **killed**.
  - If the total value of the "blood" icons of the two cards is **higher**, the Intruder is still **alive**.

**Note**: This "blood" icon represents the Intruder's current "endurance," which can vary for individual Intruders, depending on the cards drawn after each successful attack.

## Intruder Corpse Token

When an Intruder is killed, its miniature is removed, and an Intruder Carcass token is placed in the Room where it was slain. This token represents an Intruder Carcass Object

**Important**: No Intruder Corpse token is placed after killing a Larva or destroying an Intruder Egg.

## Intruder Retreat

During the Injury Effect check, Intruders may also flee:

- If a **Retreat arrow** is present in the "blood" icon of any drawn Intruder Attack card (for Creepers/Adults) or any of the two cards drawn (for Breeders/Queen), the Intruder flees.
- To determine its movement, **an Event card is drawn**, and the Intruder moves through the corridor indicated by the Event card's movement section.
