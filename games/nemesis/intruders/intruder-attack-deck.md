The Intruder Attack Deck in Nemesis is used to determine the specific effects when Intruders attack Characters. When an Intruder attacks a Character, you draw a card from this deck to determine the type and severity of damage dealt to the Character.

**Total Cards: 20**

## Intruder Attack Cards

**Important**: The Intruder Attack cards do not deal Injuries (i.e. damage) to the Queen or other Intruders, they are only used to determine her health after an Injury marker has been placed on her (due to a successful Character Attack Action or Fire).

**Important**: None of these Intruder Attack Cards can be used by Characters/Players so they are unable to deal damage to Intruders (inlcuding the Queen) by using these attacks. These are **ONLY** for attacks from Intruders (including the Queen) on Characters.

## Intruder versus Character Attacks

When Characters attack Intruders (including the Queen), they use:

- **Shoot Action**: This is Basic Action that can be performed by any Character that has a Weapon with ammo.
  - **Energy Weapons**: These include most Starting Items such as the Pilot's Shotgun or the Soldier's Assault Rifle.
  - **Classic Weapons**: These include the Flamethrower (which can be crafted) or the Captains's Pistol Starting Item.
- **Melee Attack Action**: If the Character has no ammo or Weapons they can perform this Basic Action.
- **Items**: Certain items can deal Injuries to Intruders, such as Grenades or Molotov Cocktails found in the Military Items Deck (Red Deck).
  - **Search**: Characters can use the Search Basic Action to find these items.
