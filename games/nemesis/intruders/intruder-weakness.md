Discovered Weakness cards modify the basic rules of the Intruders, providing all players a small advantage against them. They represent the crew gaining gradual knowledge on the lifeform that infests the ship.

## Setup

During game setup, 3 random Intruder Weakness cards are placed face down on the 3 Intruder Weakness slots on the Intruder board.

Each of the 3 Weakness cards is placed in a space corresponding to a different Object:

- **Intruder Eggs**: They are found in the Nest Room.
- **Character Corpse**: This is the Character Corpse token, representing either a dead Character or the body found in the Hibernatorium at the start of the game.
- **Intruder Carcass**: A Carcass token is placed after the death of any Intruder – with the exception of Larvae.

## Discovery

To discover a given Weakness card, any Character may use the Room Action in the **Laboratory Room** to research an Object. The "Analyse 1 Object" Room Action in the Laboratory Room can only be performed if one of the required Object is present in the Room, for example, carried by the Character.

After analysing an Object, reveal the corresponding Weakness card – flip it face up and leave it on the Intruder board so that all players can see the weakness.

## Specific Rules

- The Object itself is **not discarded after the research**, though you may drop it for free.
