# Intruder Weakness [1, p.21]

During game setup, 3 random Intruder Weakness cards are placed face down on the Intruder board, each corresponding to a specific Object: Character Corpse, Intruder Egg, or Intruder Carcass.

During the game you will have the possibility to discover these 3 Weaknesses. They represent the crew gaining gradual knowledge on the lifeform that infests the ship.

To discover a given Weakness card, any Character must research the corresponding Object in the Laboratory Room. 

After researching an Object, reveal the corresponding Weakness card â€“ flip it face up and leave it on the Intruder board so that all players can see the weakness.

Discovered Weakness cards modify the basic rules of all the Intruders, giving all players a small advantage against them.

Note that weaknesses apply to all Intruder types and benefit all players.
