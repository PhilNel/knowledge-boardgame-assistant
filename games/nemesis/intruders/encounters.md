# Encounters

Discard all Noise markers from Corridors connected to the Room.
Draw 1 Intruder token from the Intruder bag.
Place an Intruder miniature of the corresponding type in the Room.
Check for Surprise Attack: Compare the number on the drawn Intruder token to the number of cards in the player's hand. If the player's hand size is lower, a Surprise Attack occurs, where an Intruder Attack card is immediately drawn and resolved.
