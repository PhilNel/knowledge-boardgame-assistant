Encounters in Nemesis represent a direct confrontation with an Intruder appearing in a room where a Character is present.

## Triggers for an Encounter

An Encounter is triggered in a few specific scenarios:

- **Noise Roll**: The most common way an Encounter occurs is during a Noise roll. If you are instructed to place a Noise marker in a corridor that already contains one, an Encounter is resolved instead. This happens when a Character moves into an empty room and fails their Noise roll in a corridor that already has a Noise marker.
- **Intruder Bag Development**: When an Intruder token is drawn from the Intruder bag during the Intruder Bag Development phase, and certain conditions are met (e.g., a Queen token is drawn and Characters are in the Nest Room).
- **Event Cards**: Encounters can also be triggered by the effects of some Event cards (such as "Hatching") or certain Intruder Attack cards.
- **Note**: An Intruder moving from one Room to another Room containing a Character does not count as an Encounter.

## Resolving an Encounter

To resolve an Encounter follow the steps listed below:

1. **Discard Noise Markers**: Remove all Noise markers from all corridors connected to the Room where the Encounter is taking place. This includes Technical Corridors if there's an entrance in the Room.
2. **Draw an Intruder Token**: Draw 1 Intruder token from the Intruder bag. Each Intruder token has an Intruder Symbol on one side and a number on the opposite side.
3. **Place Intruder Miniature**: Place an Intruder miniature matching the type indicated by the drawn token's Intruder Symbol in the Room. For a description of each Intruder symbol, see the Intruder board.
4. **Check for Surprise Attack**: Compare the number on the drawn Intruder token with the total number of cards in the Character's hand (including both Action and Contamination cards).
   - If the number of cards in the Character's hand is **lower** than the number on the Intruder token, a Surprise Attack occurs.
   - If the number of cards is **equal to or higher**, nothing further happens in this step.
5. **Set Aside Intruder Token**: The drawn Intruder token is set aside. It may return to the Intruder bag if an Intruder of that type later moves into the Technical Corridors during Intruder Movement.

### Blank Token during Encounter

If you draw a Blank token from the Intruder bag during an Encounter:

- Place a **Noise marker in every corridor** connected to the room where the Encounter occurred.
- If the Blank token was the last token in the Intruder bag, add 1 Adult Intruder token to the Intruder bag (if available, otherwise nothing happens).
- The Blank token is then returned to the **Intruder bag**.
