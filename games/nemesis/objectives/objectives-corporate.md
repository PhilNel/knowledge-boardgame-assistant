This section details the contents of the Corporate Objective cards and provides some insight into these Objectives.

## Discover a Weakness
Weaknesses can be discovered by bringing an Object to the Laboratory and by performing the **Laboratory Room Action** there. For accomplishing an Objective, it doesn't matter if you're not the one who did the research, as long as the Weakness has been discovered at the end of the game.

**Key Clarifications**: 
- Intruder Eggs can be found in the Nest. 
- The Nest is always on the board.
- Objects that can be researched include: Character Corpses, Intruder Carcasses, or Intruder Eggs.

## Player X's Character Cannot Survive
This means that the Character of the indicated player cannot be alive at the end of the game. You do not need to kill them with any of your Actions - they simply must be dead. 

**Key Clarifications**: 
- If the indicated player number matches your own player number, then you must achieve "Your Character is the only survivor" instead.
- Although you cannot kill Characters directly, you can create dangerous situations: lock them in a Room with a Fire marker or an Intruder, or sabotage the ship extensively before escaping in an Escape Pod.

## Your Character is the only survivor
No Character but yours may survive the game.
