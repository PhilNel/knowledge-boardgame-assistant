Character Wounds and death in Nemesis are central mechanics that directly impact a player's ability to survive and achieve their objectives. The game features two primary types of wounds, Light Wounds and Serious Wounds, both of which can lead to a Character's death.

## Light Wounds

- When a Character suffers a Light Wound, place a Wound marker in the upper space of the Light Wound Track on their Character board.
- If a Wound marker is already there, move it to the **lower space**.
- A marker on the lower space of the Light Wounds Track means 2 Light Wounds.
- If there is already a Wound marker on the lower space, **discard it** from the Light Wound Track and the Character **suffers a Serious Wound**.
- **Summary**: 1st Light Wound → upper space, 2nd Light Wound → lower space, 3rd Light Wound → becomes a Serious Wound

## Serious Wounds

- When a Character suffers a Serious Wound, draw 1 Serious Wound card and place it next to the Character board. From now on, the player is affected by the effect described on that card.
- Each Serious Wound card has a different effect described on its card.
- **Important**: If a Character has several copies of identical Serious Wounds cards, their effects are not cumulative. It will be more difficult to get rid of their effects though.
- **Note**: A Melee Attack Action can also cause a Serious Wound if the attack misses the target.

## Death
- When a Character with 3 Serious Wounds suffers **any additional Wound** (Light or Serious), they are instantly killed.
- When a Character dies:
  - Remove their miniature from the board
  - Place a Character Corpse token in the Room where they died (this becomes a Character Corpse Object)
  - They **drop all their Heavy Objects** in the Room they died in

# Dressing and Healing Wounds

Characters can Dress and Heal their Wounds through various means (using **Clothes**, **Bandages**, **Medkit** Item cards or the **Emergency Room** Action).

Each relevant Item card or Room Action details the Wound treatment. It can be either Dress or Heal:

- **Dress Serious Wound**: Flip a Serious Wound card affecting the Character on its backside. From now on,
its effect is ignored, but it still counts against the limit of 3 Serious Wounds.
- **Heal**: Either remove (in case of a Light Wound) or discard (in case of a Dressed Serious Wound card) the Wound mentioned in the Action effect.
