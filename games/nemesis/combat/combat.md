Combat in Nemesis occurs whenever a Character and an Intruder are present in the same Room.

## Being in Combat

Whenever both a Character and an Intruder are in the same Room, they are considered to be in Combat.

- The Character may attack an Intruder in the same Room using a **Shoot Action** or a **Melee Attack Action** during their round.
- The Character may **Escape** during their round.
- **Intruders attack** Characters during the Event Phase.

## Shoot Action

To perform a Shoot Action:

1.  Choose a Weapon and 1 Intruder you want to shoot.
2.  Discard 1 Ammo from that Weapon's card.
3.  Roll the Combat die.
    - **Results**:
      - **Blank**: You miss your target.
      - **Creeper**: If your target is a Larva or Creeper, deal 1 Injury to your target. If not, you miss.
      - **Adult**: If your target is a Larva, Creeper or Adult Intruder, deal 1 Injury to your target. If not, you miss.
      - **1 "crosshair"**: Deal 1 Injury to your target (regardless of the Intruder’s type).
      - **2 "crosshairs"**: Deal 2 Injury to your target (regardless of the Intruder’s type).

**Important**: Some Weapons have special rules that may modify the Shooting Action. For example, the **Prototype Pistol** allows rerolling Combat Rolls.

## Melee Attack Action

To perform a Melee Attack Action:

1. Draw **1 Contamination card** and add it to your Action discard pile.
2. Choose 1 Intruder you want to attack.
3. Roll the Combat die.
   - **Results**:
     - **Blank**: You miss your target and your Character suffers **1 Serious Wound**.
     - **Creeper**: If your target is a Larva or Creeper, deal 1 Injury to your target. If not, you miss and your Character suffers **1 Serious Wound**.
     - **Adult**: If your target is a Larva, Creeper or Adult Intruder, deal 1 Injury to your target. If not, you miss and your Character suffers **1 Serious Wound**.
     - **1 "crosshair"**: Deal 1 Injury to your target (regardless of the Intruder’s type).
     - **2 "crosshairs"**: Deal 1 Injury (yes, only 1!) to your target (regardless of the Intruder’s type).

## Character Escape

A Character can attempt to Escape from Combat by performing a Movement Action to a neighboring Room.
**Important**: You cannot perform Careful Movement if you are in Combat.

Before moving, an Intruder Attack is resolved against the escaping Character.

**Note**: If there is more than 1 Intruder in the Room, a separate Intruder Attack is resolved for each Intruder.

- If the Character survives the attack, they move to the neighboring Room. If the destination Room is empty, a Noise roll is then performed. If it's an unexplored Room, it is explored according to standard rules.
- If the Character dies during the Escape attempt, the Character Corpse token stays in the Room they tried to escape from.

**Important**: Some Action cards, like the Soldier's "Suppressive Fire" or "Covering Fire," modify the Escape rule.
