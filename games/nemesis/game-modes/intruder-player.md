- **First Player**: The Intruder Player is omitted from First Player token rotation.
- **Player Rounds**: The Intruder player follows the standard order of play for playing their rounds, but they can only take 1 Action (by playing a card from their hand) or pass. When passing, they may choose to keep 1 card from their hand and discard the rest.

### Intruder Actions

During their round, the Intruder Player can play an Intruder Action card in one of three ways:

- **MOVE**:
  - Move any Intruder through a Corridor with a number matching the one printed on the Intruder Action card.
  - If the Intruder moves to a Technical Corridor, standard rules apply.
- **ATTACK**:
  - Choose any Intruder in the same Room as a Character.
  - The Intruder attacks that Character following standard rules, but with a special exception:
    - The Intruder Player draws a number of Intruder Attack cards equal to the number displayed on the played Player Intruder card.
    - They then choose 1 of these cards to resolve and put all others at the bottom of the Intruder Attack deck.
- **EFFECT**:
  - Resolve the effect described on the Intruder Action card.

### Event Phase

- **Time Track**: Time marker and Self-Destruct marker (if active) move 1 space right
- **Fire Damage**: Intruders in Fire rooms still suffer 1 Injury

**Note**: Surprise Attacks during Encounters or Character Escapes still occur normally.

## Victory Condition
