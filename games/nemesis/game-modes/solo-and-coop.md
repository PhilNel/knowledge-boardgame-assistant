## Solo Mode

This mode allows a player to experience Nemesis alone (i.e. single player):

- **Objective Cards**: Instead of the regular Objective cards, you draw two cards from the **Solo/Coop Objectives deck** at the start of the game. Once the first Intruder Encounter occurs, you must choose one of these two Objective cards to pursue.
- **Victory Condition**: To win in solo mode, you must fulfill your chosen objective and survive.
- **Item Availability**: The number of items available when searching rooms is reduced by half, rounded up. For example, if an Exploration Token shows 1-2 items, the Item Counter is set to 1; if it shows 3-4, it's set to 2.

## Fully Cooperative Mode

This mode is designed for players who prefer a cooperative experience without the threat of betrayal from companions.

- **Objective Cards**: At the start of the game, one card per player is drawn from the special "solo/coop Objectives" deck instead of the regular Objective cards.
- **Victory Condition**: To win the game as a group, **ALL these drawn objectives must be fulfilled**, and at least 1 Character must survive.
- **Multiple Signal Objectives**: If there's a requirement to "Send the Signal," only one Character needs to perform this action if it appears on one card. However, if two or more objective cards require sending the signal, then **that many Characters** must send the signal.

### Revive Mechanic

The Emergency Room is equipped with a specialized AutoDoc device in Fully Cooperative mode:

- If a Character dies, another Character can pick up their Corpse token and carry it to a working **Emergency Room**.
- A player whose Corpse is in the Emergency Room places their Character miniature there at the start of the turn.
- Upon revival, all their Light Wounds are discarded, and all their Serious Wounds are Dressed.
- **Important**: The Emergency Room **does not work** if there's an Intruder or a Malfunction token in it.
