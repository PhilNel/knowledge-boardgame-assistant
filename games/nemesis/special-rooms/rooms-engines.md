# Engine Rooms

The ship has 3 Engines, two of which must be functional to safely reach a destination. At the start of the game, the players don't know which Engine is functional or not. Players may check the Status of a given Engine during the game – for example in its corresponding Engine Room. At the end of the game, if the ship was not destroyed earlier, all the top Engine tokens are revealed to determine if the ship explodes or not during its attempt at a hyperspace jump.

## Check the Engine
Check the Engine status in this Engine Room – secretly look at the top Engine token. The top Engine token indicates the current state of the Engine. A malfunction marker in this room would prevent a player from performing this room action.

## Repairing or Breaking Engines
Your Character can perform a Repair/Break Engine Action in this Room. This action involves secretly checking both Engine tokens and placing them back in the order of your choice, allowing you to change the engine's status between Damaged and Working.

**Important Notes:**
- This action requires specific cards (e.g., Repairs Action card or Tools Item card).
- This can be performed even if there is a Malfunction marker in the room. Malfunction markers in Engine Rooms do not affect the engine's functional status.

You do not have to tell the truth if you have repaired the Engine or not, but you must tell if you have changed the order of the tokens.
