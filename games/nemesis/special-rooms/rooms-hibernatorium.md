# Hibernatorium
Located at the very center of the ship, this room allows characters to Try to hibernate.

**Action**: To hibernate, the hibernation chambers must be open, indicated by the Time Track reaching any blue space.

**Procedure**: A Noise roll is performed, and if no Intruder appears, the character's miniature is removed from the game, signifying safe hibernation.

**Restrictions**: You cannot enter if an Intruder is present. A Malfunction marker in the Hibernatorium does not affect already hibernated characters. The ship's destination cannot be changed, nor can the Self-Destruct sequence be initiated if any characters are already hibernating.
