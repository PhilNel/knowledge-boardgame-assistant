# Cockpit
Located in the bow section, this room allows control over the ship's navigation.

**Actions**: Players can use Flight Controls to either Check Coordinates or Set Destination.
- **Check Coordinates**: Secretly look at the Coordinates card to determine the ship's current heading.
- **Set Destination**: Move the Destination marker to a chosen space on the Destination Track.

**Restrictions**: You cannot set the destination if any characters are already hibernating or if an Intruder is present in the Cockpit.

The player should remember the Coordinates they've checked. At the end of the game, if the ship was not destroyed earlier, the Coordinates card is revealed. The position of the Destination marker indicates the destination of the ship among the four available on the Coordinates card.
