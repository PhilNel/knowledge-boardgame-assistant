# Special Rooms

The 5 Special Rooms always occupy the same place on the board â€“ these Rooms have their own specific shapes and are printed on the board. All are treated as explored at the start of the game.

Special Rooms are treated as normal Rooms, except that they are explored at the beginning of the game and that Characters cannot perform any Search Action in these Rooms. They can receive Fire or Malfunction markers normally.
