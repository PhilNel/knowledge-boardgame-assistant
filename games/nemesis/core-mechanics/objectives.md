Objectives in Nemesis are central to determining a player's victory, operating as hidden goals that must be fulfilled alongside survival. The game is semi-cooperative, meaning while players might cooperate, each has their own agenda, and another player achieving their goal is irrelevant to your own victory.

## Initial Assignment

- At the start of the game, each player is dealt **one Corporate Objective** card and **one Personal Objective** card.
- The contents of these Objective cards must be kept hidden from other players.
- The player's number (from their Help card) can be important for some Objectives.

## Choosing an Objective

- Players do not choose their objective immediately. The choice is made during a critical gameplay moment: the **First Encounter with an Intruder**.
- When the first Intruder miniature (of any type) appears on the board, each player immediately chooses one of their two Objective cards. The one that wasn't chosen is removed from the game face down (without showing it to the
other players).
- From this point on, each player has only one Objective and must work towards its completion, still keeping it secret

## Survival Condition for Victory

- To be considered a winner, a player must not only fulfill their chosen objective but also survive.
- Survival means one of two things:
    1. Hibernating their Character in the Hibernatorium with the ship still functioning and jumping to Earth.
    2. Using one of the Escape Pods to evacuate the ship. A character in a launched Escape Pod is always treated as if they have arrived on Earth.

## Sending the Signal
Send the Signal means you need to locate the **Comms Room** and perform its Room Action. There is **always** a Comms Room on board.

## Your Character is the Only Survivor
No Character but yours may survive the game.
