# Actions
Actions are the primary way characters interact with the game world. Players have a total of 2 Actions per round during the Player Phase.

There are four main categories of Actions:

- Basic Actions: Fundamental actions available to every character.
- Actions from Action Cards: Character-specific actions found on a character's unique deck of 10 Action cards.
- Actions from Item Cards: Actions tied to specific items carried by a character.
- Actions from Room Tiles (Room Actions): Special actions that can only be performed within specific rooms.

## Action Costs
Every Action has an Action Cost, indicated by a number within an icon. To pay for an Action, a player must discard the exact number of any chosen Action cards from their hand.

**Important:** Contamination cards cannot be used to pay Action Costs.
