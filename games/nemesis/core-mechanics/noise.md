# Noise

Noise is a critical mechanic that simulates the unpredictability and danger of the alien-infested ship. It is the primary way Intruders are revealed and engage characters.

## Noise Generation
A Noise roll is performed whenever a Character enters an empty Room (one without other Characters or Intruders). When a Character enters a room already occupied by another Character or Intruders then a Noise roll is not performed.

## Rolling the Noise Die
The player rolls a Noise die and resolves the result:

- Result 1, 2, 3, or 4: Place a Noise marker in the Corridor corresponding to the number rolled. If a Noise marker is already present in that Corridor, an Encounter occurs instead.
- Danger Symbol: If an Intruder is in a neighboring Room (and not in Combat), it immediately moves into the Character's Room. If no Intruders are in neighboring rooms (or are in Combat), a Noise marker is placed in every connected Corridor that doesn't already have one.
- Silence Symbol: Nothing happens. However, if the Character has a Slime marker, a "Silence" result is treated as "Danger" instead.

## Noise Markers
Noise markers indicate corridors where sound has been detected and can trigger Encounters.

# Placement Rules:
- A Corridor can never hold more than 1 Noise marker.
- Noise markers placed in the Technical Corridors space are treated as being in all Technical Corridors Entrances on the board.
- Noise markers do not affect Closed Doors; they apply to the entire corridor.

# Intruder Spawning and Encounters
An Encounter is when an Intruder appears in a Room where a Character is present, typically after drawing an Intruder token from the Intruder bag (often triggered by a Noise roll). It can also be triggered by certain Event or Intruder Attack cards.

# Entering an Occupied Room
If a Character enters a Room that already contains an Intruder, an Encounter is not resolved. Instead, the Character and Intruder are immediately considered to be in Combat.
