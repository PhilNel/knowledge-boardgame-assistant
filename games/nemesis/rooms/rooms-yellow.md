Related Systems: Signal, Self Destruct, Rooms, Engines

Rooms with yellow colored backgrounds on their action area (ship systems and control).

## Comms Room

Basic Room "1"

Enables characters to Send a Signal by placing a Status marker on their character board. This is a requirement for some objectives and is always present on the board.

## Fire Control System

Basic Room "1"

Enables characters to Initiate the Fire Control procedure, allowing them to choose any room, discard a Fire marker from it (if present), and make all Intruders in that room run away. This can be used even without a Fire marker just to clear Intruders.

## Generator

Basic Room "1"

This room allows characters to Initiate / Stop Self-Destruct Sequence.

- **Procedure**: Initiating the sequence places a Status marker on the Self-Destruct Track, which moves with the Time marker.
- **Critical Points**: When the marker reaches any yellow space on the track, the Self-Destruct Sequence cannot be aborted, and all Escape Pods automatically unlock. If the marker reaches the final red "skull" space, the ship explodes, killing all characters and Intruders on board.
- **Restriction**: Cannot start the Self-Destruct if any characters are already hibernating.

## Airlock Control

Additional Room "2"

Allows starting an Emergency Airlock procedure in another chosen Yellow Room (rooms with a yellow background on their action part), provided its corridors do not contain Destroyed Doors.

- **Effect**: Automatically closes all doors connected to the chosen room. If all doors remain closed at the end of the current Player Phase, everything in that room dies immediately, and any Fire marker is removed.

## Engine Control Room

Additional Room "2"

Allows characters to Check Engines Status for all 3 engines. Unlike the Engine Rooms themselves, this room cannot change the engines' status. This action can be performed even with a Malfunction marker in the room.
