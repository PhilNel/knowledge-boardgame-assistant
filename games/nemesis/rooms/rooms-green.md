# Rooms - Green Background

Rooms with green colored backgrounds on their action area.

## Emergency Room

Basic Room "1"

Provides options to Treat your Wounds, allowing characters to Dress all Serious Wounds, Heal one Dressed Serious Wound, or Heal all Light Wounds.

In Fully Cooperative Mode, this room is equipped with an AutoDoc, allowing a character to revive a near-death player whose Character Corpse token has been brought to the room. However, this function is unavailable if an Intruder or Malfunction token is in the room.

## Laboratory

Basic Room "1"

Allows characters to Analyse 1 object (Character Corpse, Intruder Carcass, or Egg) if one is present in the room.

- **Effect**: This action discovers one corresponding Intruder Weakness card. The object is not discarded after research. The Laboratory is always on the board.

## Surgery

Basic Room "1"

Allows characters to perform a Surgery procedure by scanning all Contamination cards (from their deck, hand, and discard pile) and removing all Infected cards.

- **Effect**: If a Larva is on the character's board, it is removed. The character suffers 1 Light Wound and automatically passes their turn, with their hand becoming empty until the next turn.

## Canteen

Additional Room "2"

Allows characters to Have a Snack... to Heal 1 Light Wound.

- **Additional Effect**: Characters may also choose to Scan all Contamination cards in their hand and remove all non-Infected cards. If any card is Infected, a Larva miniature is placed on the character board; if a Larva is already present, the character dies, and a Creeper is placed in the room.
