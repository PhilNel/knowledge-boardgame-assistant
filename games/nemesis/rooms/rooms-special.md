The five special rooms are:

1. The Cockpit
2. The three Engine Rooms
3. The Hibernatorium

## Cockpit

Located in the bow section, this room allows control over the ship's navigation.

**Actions**: Players can use Flight Controls to either Check Coordinates or Set Destination.

- **Check Coordinates**: Secretly look at the Coordinates card to determine the ship's current heading.
- **Set Destination**: Move the Destination marker to a chosen space on the Destination Track.

**Restrictions**: You cannot set the destination if any characters are already hibernating or if an Intruder is present in the Cockpit.

The player should remember the Coordinates they've checked. At the end of the game, if the ship was not destroyed earlier, the Coordinates card is revealed. The position of the Destination marker indicates the destination of the ship among the four available on the Coordinates card.

## Engine Rooms

The ship has 3 Engines, two of which must be functional to safely reach a destination. At the start of the game, the players don't know which Engine is functional or not. Players may check the Status of a given Engine during the game – for example in its corresponding Engine Room. At the end of the game, if the ship was not destroyed earlier, all the top Engine tokens are revealed to determine if the ship explodes or not during its attempt at a hyperspace jump.

### Check the Engine

Check the Engine status in this Engine Room – secretly look at the top Engine token. The top Engine token indicates the current state of the Engine. A malfunction marker in this room would prevent a player from performing this room action.

### Repairing or Breaking Engines

Your Character can perform a Repair/Break Engine Action in this Room. This action involves secretly checking both Engine tokens and placing them back in the order of your choice, allowing you to change the engine's status between Damaged and Working.

**Important Notes:**

- This action requires specific cards (e.g., Repairs Action card or Tools Item card).
- This can be performed even if there is a Malfunction marker in the room. Malfunction markers in Engine Rooms do not affect the engine's functional status.

You do not have to tell the truth if you have repaired the Engine or not, but you must tell if you have changed the order of the tokens.

## Hibernatorium

Located at the very center of the ship, this room allows characters to Try to hibernate.

**Action**: To hibernate, the hibernation chambers must be open, indicated by the Time Track reaching any blue space.

**Procedure**: A Noise roll is performed, and if no Intruder appears, the character's miniature is removed from the game, signifying safe hibernation.

**Restrictions**: You cannot enter if an Intruder is present. A Malfunction marker in the Hibernatorium does not affect already hibernated characters. The ship's destination cannot be changed, nor can the Self-Destruct sequence be initiated if any characters are already hibernating.
