# Rooms - Grey Background

Rooms with grey colored backgrounds on their action area.

## Evacuation Section A / Evacuation Section B

These rooms allow characters to Try to enter an Escape Pod.

- **Procedure**: This action can only be performed if an Escape Pod in the corresponding section is Unlocked and has at least one empty space. A Noise roll is performed, and if no Intruder appears, the character enters the pod.
- **Restriction**: Characters cannot enter an Escape Pod if any Intruder is present in the Evacuation Section Room.

## Cabins

Offers a passive benefit to Catch a breath; if a character starts a new turn in this room without Intruders, they draw 1 additional Action card (up to 6 instead of 5). This passive feature does not work if a Malfunction token is in the room.

## Hatch Control System

Provides the ability to Lock/Unlock 1 Escape Pod.

## Shower Room

Allows characters to Take a Shower, which discards a Slime marker if one is present.

- **Additional Effect**: Similar to the Canteen, characters may also choose to Scan all Contamination cards in their hand and remove all non-Infected cards. If any card is Infected, a Larva miniature is placed on the character board; if a Larva is already present, the character dies, and a Creeper is placed in the room.
- **Note**: A Fire marker can be placed in the Shower Room in the normal way. The Take a Shower Action does not discard a Fire marker from the Shower Room.
