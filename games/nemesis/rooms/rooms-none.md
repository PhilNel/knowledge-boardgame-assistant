# Rooms - No Color Background

Rooms with no colored background on their action area.

**Important:** A Malfunction marker can never be placed in the Nest or in the Room Covered In Slime.

## Nest

This room is always on the board.

- **Actions**: Characters can Take one Egg from the Intruder Board (representing Eggs in the Nest), which requires a subsequent Noise roll.
- **Destroying Eggs**: Eggs can be destroyed using Shoot Actions or Melee Attack Actions (each injury destroys 1 Egg, and misses on Melee attacks do not cause wounds or contamination for this purpose). Grenades destroy 2 Eggs, and Molotov Cocktails destroy 1 Egg. After each attempt to destroy an Egg, a Noise roll must be performed.
- **Effect**: The Nest is considered destroyed when no Eggs remain, marked by placing an Injury marker on it. Fire markers in the room will destroy uncarried Eggs during the Event Phase.
- **Restrictions**: Searching is not allowed in this room. Eggs are considered Heavy Objects.

## Room Covered with Slime

Upon entering this room, a character automatically receives a Slime marker. Searching is not allowed in this room.
