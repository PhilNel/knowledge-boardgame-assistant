Noise represents sounds echoing throughout the ship from machinery or Intruders. It's a crucial mechanic that dictates Intruder movement and potential encounters.

## When Noise Rolls Occur

A Noise roll is performed when:

- A Character enters an **empty Room** (one without other Characters or Intruders)
- **You do NOT roll** if entering a room already occupied by Characters or Intruders
- Certain Event cards instruct all Characters to perform Noise rolls
- Taking or destroying eggs in the Nest requires Noise rolls

## Noise Roll Results

Roll a Noise die and resolve:

**Numbered Results (1, 2, 3, or 4)**: Place a Noise marker in the Corridor corresponding to the number rolled. If that Corridor already has a Noise marker, an **Encounter** occurs instead.

**Danger Symbol**:

- If an Intruder is in a neighboring Room (and not in Combat), it immediately moves into your Room
- If no eligible Intruders are in neighboring rooms, place a Noise marker in every connected Corridor that doesn't already have one

**Silence Symbol**:

- Normally nothing happens
- However, if your Character has a **Slime marker**, treat "Silence" as "Danger" instead

## Noise Markers

Noise markers mark Corridors for Noise roll purposes only.

**Placement Rules**:

- A Corridor can never hold more than 1 Noise marker
- **Technical Corridors**: Markers placed in Technical Corridors space apply to all Technical Corridor Entrances on the board
- **Doors**: Closed Doors do not affect Noise markers - they apply to the entire Corridor
- When Intruders move through Technical Corridors, they are removed but Noise markers remain

## Other Noise Triggers

**Exploration Tokens**: Some revealed tokens have "Silence," "Danger," or "Noise" effects that directly affect noise without rolling.

**Event Cards**: Certain events can instruct all Characters to perform Noise rolls.

**Nest Actions**: Taking or destroying eggs requires Noise rolls after each attempt.

## Encounters

When a Noise roll would place a marker in a Corridor that already has one:

- All Noise markers are discarded from Corridors connected to that Room
- Draw an Intruder token from the Intruder bag
- Place corresponding Intruder miniature in the Room
- **Surprise Attack** may occur based on cards in Character's hand vs number on Intruder token
- If Blank token is drawn, place Noise markers in each connected Corridor instead
- Intruders can appear through Closed Doors if triggered by Noise

## Noise Mitigation

**Careful Movement**: This basic action allows you to place a Noise marker in a chosen Corridor instead of rolling for Noise, provided not all connected Corridors already have markers. Cannot be used in Combat.

## Combat vs Encounters

**Important Distinction**:

- **Encounter**: Intruder appears due to Noise roll/token draw
- **Combat**: Character enters room with existing Intruder (no Encounter process)
