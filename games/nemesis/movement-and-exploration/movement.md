Character movement in Nemesis is a fundamental aspect of gameplay, allowing characters to navigate the ship, discover new areas, and interact with various systems and threats. It primarily occurs through **Movement** or **Careful Movement** Actions and has specific rules depending on the state of the rooms and the presence of Intruders.

## Character Movement

- **Basic Movement Action**:
  - The most common way to move is by performing a Movement Action.
  - This action involves moving your Character miniature to a **neighboring Room**.
  - To perform a Basic Movement Action, you must discard 1 Action card from your hand to pay its cost.
- **Neighboring Rooms**:
  - Two rooms are considered neighboring if they are **directly connected** by 1 Corridor.
  - Closed Doors **block** the "neighboring" status for character movement, preventing passage through that corridor.
  - Doors can be Open, Closed, or Destroyed, and various game elements can change their status.

## Rooms and Corridors

- **Rooms**: Character miniatures may be placed and perform Actions **only in Rooms** (keep in mind that Special Rooms, such as the Hibernatorium, Engines or Cockpit are treated as normal Rooms).
- **Escape Pods**: Escape Pod tokens are the only exception to the rule above.
- **Intruders**: Intruder miniatures may also **only** be placed in Rooms.
- **Corridors**: These **connect** the Rooms, and are used to move between Rooms, though neither Characters nor Intruders can ever stop in them for any reason.
- **Effects**: The effects of moving through any given Corridor are resolved **after** moving into the Room.

## Entering a Room

After entering a Room, always resolve the following steps:

1. If this Room tile was unexplored (face down), turn it over (face up). After doing that reveal the **Exploration Token** lying on that
   Room tile.
2. If the Character enters an empty Room (explored or unexplored, with **neither Characters nor Intruders**), perform a **Noise roll**.
   **Note**: If there is anyone (either a Character or an Intruder) in the Room the Character is entering, **do not** perform a Noise roll.
