## Effects on Room Actions

If a Malfunction marker is present in a Room, that **Room's Action is no longer available**. This applies even to Special Rooms like the Hibernatorium, Cockpit, or Engines.

**Important Engine Exception**: You can still Repair/Break an Engine even if the Engine Room has a Malfunction marker, since the disabled room action is "Check Engine Status" not the repair function.

## Effects on Other Room Features

- **Search Actions**: Malfunction markers do **not** prevent Search Actions from being performed in that Room.
- **Computers**: If a Room has a Computer icon but contains a Malfunction marker, the Computer becomes unavailable, as if there were no Computer icon present.
- **Engine Status**: A Malfunction marker in an Engine Room does not affect the Engine's Working/Damaged status - only the room action. You can still check Engine status in the Engine Control Room and still Repair/Break Engines.

## Ship Hull Integrity (Game End)

There are 8 Malfunction markers in game. If you are instructed to place a **9th Malfunction marker** and none are available from the pool, the ship immediately loses hull integrity and explodes, killing all Characters (awake or hibernated) and Intruders on board.

## How Malfunction Markers Are Placed

- **Exploration tokens**: "Malfunction" exploration tokens place markers when rooms are first entered
- **Event cards**: Certain events can place Malfunction markers
- **Other game effects**: Various Actions may also cause malfunctions

## Removal of Malfunction Markers

- **Repair Action cards**: Various Action cards can discard Malfunction markers
- **Tools Item card**: Found in Technical Items (Yellow Deck), allows "Discard Malfunction"
- **Duct Tape**: Also in Technical Items (Yellow Deck), can "Discard Malfunction"

## Specific Rules

- A Room can **never hold more than one Malfunction marker** at a time. If you are instructed to place another one, nothing happens
- Discarded Malfunction markers are returned to the pool for future use
- Malfunction markers **cannot be placed** in the Nest or Room Covered In Slime
