## Slime Marker

The Slime marker is a universal Status marker, placed in the Slime slot of the Character board [[R1-SLIME,17]].

## Effects of Slime

As long as the Character has a Slime marker on their Character board, each "Silence" result of a Noise roll (and each "Silence" exploration token) should instead be considered as "Danger" [[R1-SLIME,17]]. This means that instead of a safe result, you risk Intruder movement or additional Noise markers being placed.

## Acquiring Slime Markers

Characters can gain Slime markers through several methods:

- **Room Covered with Slime**: Automatically receive a Slime marker upon entering this particular room [[R1-ROOMS,25]]
- **Intruder Attacks**: Some Intruder Attack cards can inflict Slime markers [[ATK1]]
- **Exploration Tokens**: Slime exploration tokens place a Slime marker on your Character board [[R1-MOVEMENT,15]]

## Limitations

A Character may only have 1 Slime marker at a time [[R1-SLIME,17]]. If they are instructed to get another while they have one, nothing happens.

## Removing Slime Markers

Characters can remove Slime markers through:

- **Clothes Item card**: Found in both Medical (Green) and Technical (Yellow) Item Decks [[ITM1-GREEN]] [[ITM1-YELLOW]], allows you to "Discard Slime"
- **Shower Room Action**: The "Take a Shower" action in the Shower Room [[R1-ROOMS,25]] removes the Slime marker. This action also allows you to scan all Contamination cards in your hand and remove all non-Infected cards.
