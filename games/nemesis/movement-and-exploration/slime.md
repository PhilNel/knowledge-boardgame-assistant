## Slime Marker

The Slime marker is a universal Status marker, placed in the Slime slot of the Character board.

## Effects of Slime

As long as the Character has a Slime marker on their Character board, each "Silence" result of a Noise roll (and each "Silence" exploration token) should instead be considered as "Danger". This means that instead of a safe result, you risk Intruder movement or additional Noise markers being placed.

## Acquiring Slime Markers

Characters can gain Slime markers through several methods:

- **Room covered with slime**: Automatically receive a Slime marker upon entering
- **Intruder attacks**: Some Intruder Attack cards can inflict Slime markers
- **Exploration tokens**: "SLIME" exploration tokens place a Slime marker on your Character board
- **Other game effects**: Various cards and events may also cause Slime markers

## Limitations

A Character may only have 1 Slime marker at a time. If they are instructed to get another while they have one, nothing happens.

## Removing Slime Markers

Characters can remove Slime markers through:

- **Clothes Item card**: Found in both Medical (Green) and Technical (Yellow) Item Decks, allows you to "Discard Slime"
- **Shower Room Action**: The "Take a Shower" action in the Shower Room removes the Slime marker. This action also allows you to scan all Contamination cards in your hand and remove all non-Infected cards.

## Examples

- If you roll for Noise and get "Silence" while having a Slime marker, treat it as "Danger" instead
- The "Room covered with slime" automatically gives you a Slime marker when you enter
