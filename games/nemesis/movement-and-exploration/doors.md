# Doors

In Nemesis, Doors represent barriers that regulate movement between Rooms on the ship. They are represented by Door tokens and are placed specifically within Corridors that connect Rooms.

## Door States

- **Open Doors**: At the beginning of the game, all Corridors have Open Doors. The absence of a Door token is used to indicate an Open Door. Characters and Intruders can move through Open Doors.
- **Closed Doors**: These are marked by a standing Door token in a Corridor. A Closed Door prevents Characters and Intruders from moving through that Corridor. This also affects actions like throwing a Grenade.
- **Destroyed Doors**: These are marked by a lying Door token. Once a Door is Destroyed, movement is allowed through that Corridor, but it can never be Closed again. The only exception to this is the Plasma Torch Item, which can affect Destroyed Doors (see the Mechanic's Item cards).

## Door Placement
Door tokens can be placed in a Corridor due to Exploration tokens being revealed when a Room is first entered. If you are instructed to place a Door token and none are left in the pool, you must take any Door token already on the board and place it in the required Corridor.

### Placement Limitations
- **Token Limit**: Each Corridor may never hold more than 1 Door token
- **Technical Corridors**: Door tokens can never be placed in Technical Corridors

## Changing Door Status

- **Actions**: Specific Actions (e.g. Demolition) can be used to destroy doors.
- **Events**: Door status can be changed by certain Event.
- **Items**: The Energy Charge, Tools and Plasma Torch (Mechanic Only) Items allows for opening or closing a door.
- **Command Center**: The Room Action allows a Character to choose any Room and Close or Open any Doors in its connected Corridors.
- **Airlock Control**: The Room Action automatically closes doors in connected corridors of a chosen Yellow Room as part of an emergency procedure.
- **Intruder Movement**: When an Intruder tries to move through a Corridor with a Closed Door token, the Intruder does not move, but destroys the Door instead. If multiple Intruders move simultaneously from the same Room through a Closed Door, they all destroy the Door and remain in their starting Room.

## Interactions with Other Game Mechanics

- **Movement**: Closed Doors block the "neighboring" status between Rooms, meaning a Character cannot simply move through them.
- **Noise Markers**: Door tokens do not affect Noise markers. A Noise marker in a Corridor with a Closed Door still affects the entire Corridor.
- **Intruder Encounters**: If a Noise roll causes an Intruder to appear from a Corridor with a Closed Door, the Intruder still appears regardless of the Closed Door.
