In Nemesis, Doors represent barriers that regulate movement between Rooms on the ship. They are represented by Door tokens and are placed specifically within Corridors that connect Rooms [[R1-DOORS]].

## Door States

- **Open Doors**: At the beginning of the game, all Corridors have Open Doors [[R1-DOORS]]. The absence of a Door token is used to indicate an Open Door. Characters and Intruders can move through Open Doors [[R1-DOORS]].
- **Closed Doors**: These are marked by a standing Door token in a Corridor. A Closed Door prevents Characters and Intruders from moving through that Corridor [[R1-DOORS]]. This also affects actions like throwing a Grenade [[R1-DOORS]]. 
- **Destroyed Doors**: These are marked by a lying Door token. Once a Door is Destroyed, movement is allowed through that Corridor, but it can never be Closed again [[R1-DOORS]]. The only exception to this is the Plasma Torch Item, which can affect Destroyed Doors [[MECH1]].

## Door Placement
Door tokens can be placed in a Corridor due to Exploration tokens [[R1-MOVEMENT]] being revealed when a Room is first entered. If you are instructed to place a Door token and none are left in the pool, you must take any Door token already on the board and place it in the required Corridor [[R1-DOORS]].

### Placement Limitations
- **Token Limit**: Each Corridor may never hold more than 1 Door token [[R1-DOORS]]
- **Technical Corridors**: Door tokens can never be placed in Technical Corridors [[R1-TECHCORR]]

## Changing Door Status

- **Actions**: Specific Actions (e.g. Demolition) can be used to destroy doors [[CHARACTION]].
- **Events**: Door status can be changed by certain Events [[EVT1]].
- **Items**: The Energy Charge[[ITM1-YELLOW]] [[ITM1-RED]], Tools and Plasma Torch (Mechanic Only) [[MECH2]] Items allows for opening or closing a door.
- **Command Center**: The Room Action allows a Character to choose any Room and Close or Open any Doors in its connected Corridors [[R1-ROOMS]].
- **Airlock Control**: The Room Action automatically closes doors in connected corridors of a chosen Yellow Room as part of an "Emergency Airlock procedure" [[R1-ROOMS]].
- **Intruder Movement**: When an Intruder tries to move through a Corridor with a Closed Door token, the Intruder does not move, but destroys the Door instead [[R1-DOORS]]. If multiple Intruders move simultaneously from the same Room through a Closed Door, they all destroy the Door and remain in their starting Room [[R1-DOORS]].

## Interactions with Other Game Mechanics

- **Movement**: Closed Doors block the "neighboring" status between Rooms, meaning a Character cannot simply move through them [[R1-DOORS]].
- **Noise Markers**: Door tokens do not affect Noise markers. A Noise marker in a Corridor with a Closed Door still affects the entire Corridor [[R1-NOISE]].
- **Intruder Encounters**: If a Noise roll causes an Intruder to appear from a Corridor with a Closed Door, the Intruder still appears regardless of the Closed Door [[R1-DOORS]].
