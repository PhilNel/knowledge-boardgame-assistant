Once the board is set up, players prepare their individual character components:

## Player Assignment

- **Deal Help Cards**: Take as many Help Cards as there are players and deal one to each player at random (e.g., 1-3 for 3 players) to determine player order and numbers
- **Provide Inventory Holders**: Each player receives a plastic Inventory Card holder matching their Help Card number. It is used to keep your Item cards hidden during the game (store all your non-Heavy Items).


## Objectives

- **Remove Inappropriate Cards**: Remove Objective cards that specify more players than current game
- **Shuffle Decks**: Shuffle Corporate and Personal Objective decks separately
- **Deal Cards**: Each player receives 1 Corporate and 1 Personal Objective card (kept hidden)
- **Note**: Players choose one Objective after the first Intruder encounter

## Character Selection

- **Character Draft**: Shuffle Character draft cards. Player 1 draws 2, chooses 1, shuffles the other back. Next, Player 2 chooses their Character the same way, then Player 3, etc.

## Character Components

Each player takes their chosen character's components:

- **Character Board**: Place in front of player
- **Character Miniature**: Place in Hibernatorium with colored ring
- **Action Deck**: Shuffle and place face down on left side of Character board
- **Starting Weapon**: Place in Hand slot with full Ammo markers
- **Quest Items**: Place horizontally (inactive) next to Character board
- **Discard Pile**: Space on Character board where your used Action cards (and Contamination cards) will go.

## Final Setup

- **First Player Token**: Give to Player 1
- **Blue Character Corpse**: Place in Hibernatorium (represents deceased crew member). During the game, treat this token as a Character Corpse Object.
