The setup procedure in Nemesis is divided into two main phases: Board Setup and Crew Setup, involving a series of steps to prepare the game components and allocate initial items and objectives to players.

## Game Board

- Place basic board (red arrow in upper left)
- **Room Tiles**: Shuffle and place "2" tiles randomly on "2" slots, then "1" tiles on "1" slots
- **Exploration Tokens**: Shuffle and place one on each room tile. Remaining tokens are returned to the box
- **Coordinates**: Place one random Coordinates card face down on its designated space next to the Cockpit
- **Destination Marker**: Place a Status marker on the "B" space of the Destination Track (this serves as the Destination marker)

## Escape Pods

- **Count**: 2 (1-2 players), 3 (3-4 players), 4 (5 players)
- **Placement**: The lowest-numbered Escape Pod is placed in Section "A", the next in numerical order in Section "B", and so on, alternating between "A" and "B"
- **Status**: All Escape Pod tokens are placed with their "Locked" side face up

## Engines

- For each Engine slot (1, 2, 3): shuffle both Engine tokens (one Damaged, one Working) face down and place one atop the other
- **Note**: The top token indicates the true status, which players should not see.

## Intruders

- **Intruder Board**: Place 5 Intruder Egg tokens, 3 random Weakness cards (face down) in their corresponding slots
- **Intruder Bag**: 1 Blank, 4 Larvae, 1 Creeper, 1 Queen, **3 Adults + 1 Adult per player**

## Decks and Components

- **Item Decks**: Shuffle Red, Yellow, Green decks
- **Craft Items Deck**: Place next to Item Decks (these cards are not shuffled)
- **Other Decks**: Shuffle Event, Intruder Attack, Contamination, Serious Wound decks
- **Scanner**: Place next to Contamination deck
- **Time Marker**: Place on green space of Time Track
- **Other Components**: Place all remaining markers, tokens, and dice near the board for easy access
