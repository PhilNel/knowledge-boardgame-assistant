Related Systems: Coordinates, Victory, Objectives, Cockpit

The Coordinates system in Nemesis is crucial for determining the ship's final destination, which directly impacts the survival and victory conditions for characters who choose to hibernate.

## Setup

- During game setup, Coordinates cards are shuffled (without looking at their fronts) and one is placed randomly, face down, on its designated space next to the Cockpit.
- A Status marker is placed on the "B" space on the Destination Track. This is the Destination marker.
- The position of the Destination marker on the Destination Track indicates the **ship's final destination** among the four available on the Coordinates card.

## Interaction

Located in the bow section, the Cockpit Room allows control a Character to **Check Coordinates** and **Set Destination** as two separate Room Action.

# Coordinates Deck

**Total Cards: 8**

Each Coordinates card contains four possible destinations (A, B, C, D). The Destination marker's position on the Destination Track determines which destination the ship reaches.
