Escape Pods are crucial elements in Nemesis, serving as one of the primary ways for Characters to survive and potentially win the game.

## Game Setup

- At the start of the game, a specific number of Escape Pod tokens are chosen based on the player count:
  - 2 for 1-2 players
  - 3 for 3-4 players
  - 4 for 5 players
- These tokens are placed in numerical order in Sections "A" and "B" of the board, alternating between the two sections.
- All Escape Pod tokens begin the game in a **"Locked" status**, displayed face up.
- Escape Pods have a limited capacity of 2 Characters per pod.

## Unlocking Escape Pods

There are various ways to unlock Escape Pods:

- **Critical Gameplay Moments**: All Escape Pods automatically unlock in two critical game moments:
  - When the **first Character dies** in the game.
  - When the Self-Destruct Track marker reaches any yellow space. Once automatically unlocked, they can still be locked again normally.
- **Hatch Control System Room Action**: Flip 1 Escape Pod token to its Locked or Unlocked side.
  - **Warning**: This room is an Additional Room "2" so it is not always present on the board.
- **Military (Red) Deck Evacuation Key**: If you are in an Evacuation Section Room, Lock or Unlock 1 of the Escape Pods in this Evacuation Section.
  - **Note**: This Item can be found in the Military Items (Red) Deck.
- **Pilot's Evacuation Key**: If you are in the Evacuation Section Room, Lock or Unlock 1 of the Escape Pods in this Evacuation Section.
  - **Note**: This is one of the Pilot's Quest Items which requires 1 Action card and discarding of Energy Charge to activate. One Use Only, Out of Combat Only.
