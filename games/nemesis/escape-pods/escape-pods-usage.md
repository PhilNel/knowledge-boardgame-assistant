This section covers how to enter, launch, and exit Escape Pods during gameplay.

## Entering an Escape Pod

To enter an Escape Pod, a Character must be in the corresponding Evacuation Section Room (A or B):

- **Unlocked**: The Escape Pod must be Unlocked and have at least one empty space. Each pod has two spaces and can accommodate up to two Characters.
- **No Malfunction or Intruders**: No Intruder miniatures or Malfunction tokens can be present in the Evacuation Section Room.
- **Noise Roll**: The Character must perform a Noise roll when attempting to enter.
  - If any Intruder appears in the room as a result of this roll, the attempt to enter fails.
  - If no Intruder appears, the Character's miniature is placed in an available space within the Unlocked Escape Pod.
- **Note**: Heavy Objects carried by the Character do not occupy any space within the Escape Pod.

## Launching an Escape Pod

After entering, a Character can decide to launch the Escape Pod immediately or wait:

- **Waiting**: If waiting, a Character can decide to launch at the start of their first round during any Player Phase. If they choose not to launch in their round, they automatically pass that turn.
- **Launching**: If another Character enters the same Escape Pod, they can also decide to launch it immediately.
- **Effects**: Upon launching, the Character's miniature and the Escape Pod token are removed from the game:
  - The Character no longer actively participates in the game and can only spectate.
  - A Character in a launched Escape Pod is considered to have arrived on Earth.

## Exiting an Escape Pod

- A Character can **voluntarily** exit an Escape Pod during their round without using an action. To do so, they simply place their miniature back into the corresponding Evacuation Section Room.
- If an **Intruder appears** in the Evacuation Section Room while characters are waiting in an Escape Pod, all characters in that pod are automatically returned to the Evacuation Section Room.
