# Victory Check

If at least one Character has survived (either hibernating or having evacuated via an Escape Pod) when the game ends, a Victory Check is performed:

## Engines Check
All three Engine tokens are revealed. If 2 or 3 Engines are Damaged, the ship explodes, and any Characters still hibernating die.

## Coordinates Check
The Coordinates card is revealed. If the ship is not headed toward Earth (unless a specific Objective overrides this, like the Quarantine objective for Mars), any Characters asleep in the Hibernatorium die.

## Contamination Check
Each surviving Character scans their Contamination cards. If any "INFECTED" card is found, that Character dies.

## Objective Check
Finally, any Characters still alive check if they have successfully completed their chosen Objective. Multiple players can win, as objectives are individual.
