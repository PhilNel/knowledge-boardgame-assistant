# Event Phase [1, p.10]

The game progresses through a series of consecutive **turns** and ends when any of the end game conditions are met. Each turn is split into two consecutive **Phases**: the Player Phase and the Event Phase.

The Event Phase resolves various threats and advances the game state. It includes:

1. **Time Track:** The Time marker moves 1 space to the right on the Time Track. If the Self-Destruct Sequence is active, its marker also moves 1 space to the right on its Track.
2. Intruder Attack: Any Intruder currently in Combat with a Character attacks that Character.
3. **Fire Damage:** Each Intruder located in a Room with a Fire marker suffers 1 Injury.
4. **Resolve Event Card:** One Event card is drawn and resolved. This typically involves Intruder movement (based on symbols and corridor numbers on the card) and then a specific Event Effect.
5. **Intruder Bag Development:** One Intruder token is drawn from the Intruder bag and its effect is resolved. This can lead to new Intruders being added to the bag (e.g., Larva → Adult, Creeper → Breeder), Noise rolls for all players (Adult, Breeder), or specific events like the Queen appearing in the Nest or adding an Egg token (Queen).
6. **End of the Turn:** After all steps of the Intruder bag development are resolved (including any triggered Encounters or Surprise Attacks), the current turn ends, and a new turn begins with the Player Phase.
