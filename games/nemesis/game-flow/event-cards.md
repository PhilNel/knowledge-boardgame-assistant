# Resolve Event Card [1, p.10]

Event cards are resolved during the Event Phase.
Resolving the event card consists of two steps:

1. **Intruder Movement:** All Intruders sharing the Intruder Symbol shown on the Event card (and that are not in a Room with any Characters) move to a neighbouring Room through the Corridor showing the number on the Event card. This information is shown along the top of the card in the form of Intruder symbols (i.e. Larva, Creepers, Adult, Breeders, Queen) and a number iF the top right corner. If the number indicates a Technical Corridor, remove that Intruder miniature from the board and put its corresponding Intruder token in the Intruder bag.
2. **Event Effect:** After the Intruder movement step, resolve the effect described on the Event card. This is in the form of a heading and text on the bottom half of the card.

After resolving the Event card, discard it in the Event discard pile (unless the text on the card says differently).
If the Event deck runs out of cards (this, however, happens very rarely), shuffle the discarded Event cards â€“ they become the new Event deck.
