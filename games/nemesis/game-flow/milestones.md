# Key Game Progression Milestones

## Hibernation Chambers Open
When the Time Track reaches any blue space, the Hibernation chambers become accessible. Characters cannot enter them before this point.

## Self-Destruct Critical Point
If the Self-Destruct Track reaches any yellow space, all Escape Pods are automatically unlocked, and the Self-Destruct sequence can no longer be stopped.

## Game Timing
These milestones control when certain escape options become available and when critical game states are reached.
