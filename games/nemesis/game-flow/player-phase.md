# Player Phase [1, p.10]
The game progresses through a series of consecutive **turns** and ends when any of the end game conditions are met. Each turn is split into two consecutive **Phases**: the Player Phase and the Event Phase.

The Player Phase is where characters perform their actions. It consists of the following steps:

1. **Draw Action Cards:** At the start of each Player Phase, all players draw cards from their Action deck until they have a hand size of 5 cards. If the game (at any time) requires you to draw a card and add it to your hand, and your Action deck is empty, shuffle all the cards in your discard pile – these will form your new Action deck. Then, draw the required number of cards.
2. **First Player Token:** After all the Players have drawn their Action cards, the player with the First Player token passes it to the player on their left. Each time players are required to do anything in order, start with the player with the First Player token, and then continue with each player in clockwise order.
   **Note:** In the first turn of the game, do not pass the First Player token.
3. **Player Rounds:** Starting with the player who has the First Player token, and proceeding clockwise, each player performs a round of 2 Actions.

When each player has performed their round of 2 Actions (or passed their round), the next series of rounds takes place. Each player in order performs 2 Actions (or passes) – this takes place as long as there is at least one player who has not passed. When all players have passed, move to the Event Phase.

### Passing [1, p.10]

- If a player cannot perform any Actions, or chooses to take no Actions in their round, they must pass.
- If a player performs only 1 Action instead of the required two, they must pass.
- Any player who already passed cannot perform ANY Actions later during that Phase.
- When a player passes, they may discard any number of cards from their hand to their Discard.
