A game of Nemesis may result in multiple winners. While the players can (and should, to some degree) cooperate, each player has their own Objective to fulfill. Other players achieving their goals are irrelevant to your own victory.

To consider a player a winner, they must meet 2 conditions:

1. Fulfill their objective, detailed on the Objective card chosen by the player.
2. Survive – meaning one of these two options:
   [1] Hibernate their Character in the Hibernatorium with the ship still functioning and jumping to Earth.
   [2] use one of the Escape Pods to evacuate the ship.

**Important**: Some Objective cards may ask a Character to change the ship's destination – for instance, the ship must be redirected to Mars instead of going back to Earth.
