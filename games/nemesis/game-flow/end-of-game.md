# End of Game Conditions

The game concludes when any of the following conditions are met:

## Time Runs Out
The Time marker moves onto the final red space of the Time Track. The ship immediately jumps into hyperspace, and all Characters on board who are not in hibernation die from the g-force.

## Ship Destruction
The ship is destroyed when any of these occur:
- The Self-Destruct marker reaches the final red space (skull icon) on its track
- A 9th Fire marker is instructed to be placed (exceeding the 8 available)
- A 9th Malfunction marker is instructed to be placed (exceeding the 8 available)

In all these cases, the ship explodes or loses hull integrity, and all Characters on board (awake or hibernated) die. Intruders also die.

## Last Character Dies/Escapes/Hibernates
If the last active Character on board the ship dies, hibernates, or uses an Escape Pod, the game ends immediately. The relevant time or self-destruct marker is moved to its final red space and its effects resolved.
