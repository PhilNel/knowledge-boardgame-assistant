# End of Game Conditions

The game concludes when any of the following conditions are met:

## Time Runs Out

The Time marker moves onto the final red space of the Time Track. The ship immediately jumps into hyperspace, and all Characters on board who are not in hibernation die from the g-force.

**Important:** Instant death due to hyperjump does not apply to the Intruders, so if your Objective was to kill the Queen, a Breeder or to destroy the Nest, your target is unharmed, and you fail your mission.

## Ship Destruction

The ship is destroyed when any of these occur:

- The Self-Destruct marker reaches the final red space (skull icon) on its track
- A 9th Fire marker is instructed to be placed (exceeding the 8 available)
- A 9th Malfunction marker is instructed to be placed (exceeding the 8 available)

In all these cases, the ship explodes or loses hull integrity, and all Characters on board (awake or hibernated) die. Everything else on board the ship also dies, including Intruders (this may be important for some Objectives).

## Last Character Dies/Escapes/Hibernates

The last alive, not hibernating Character on board the ship dies, hibernates or uses an Escape Pod â€“ meaning there is nothing more to do on the ship.

If the Self-Destruct sequence was active, move its marker to the final red space of the Self-Destruct Track. If not, move the Time marker to the final red space of the Time Track. In both cases resolve the effects of those markers as described above.

## Victory Check

If one of the conditions above is met and at least 1 Character survived (either asleep in the Hibernatorium or evacuated in an Escape Pod), go to the Victory Check step.
